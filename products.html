         Improves the power of any turbocharged application by rapidly reducing inherent heat levels of the compressed intake air charge before entering the engine.Utilizing a tube and fin design, the intercooler acts as a large heat exchanger that dissipates the heat generated by the compression of the intake charge without creating reductions in boost pressure or response.
